# Add this to requirements.txt to enable kustomize alternative
# Option 1: Use Python YAML manipulation instead of kustomize binary
ruamel.yaml==0.18.6  # Better YAML preservation than PyYAML

# Option 2: Download kustomize binary at runtime (if we want to keep kustomize approach)
# No additional packages needed, but requires downloading binary in function startup
